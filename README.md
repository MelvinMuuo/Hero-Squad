## Description
Hero-Squad is an app that allows the user to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character-type of your choosing). The user creates a Hero object that should have: a name, age, special power and weakness. The user also creates Squad object that should have: a max size, name, and a cause they're are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc).

## Technologies Used
This project was created using:
  1. Junit
  2. Gradle
  3. Spark
## Behavior-Driven Development 
BDD is a common process in which the developer's focus begins on the behaviors that they want to see in their final application rather than thinking first about the code..
1. Create a Hero object: At the very least, they should have a name, age, special power and weakness.
2. Create a Squad object: They should have a max size, name, and a cause they're are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc).
3. Allow users to assign Heros to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
